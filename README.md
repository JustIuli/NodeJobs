NodeJobs App

NodeJobs is a web application for listing job opportunities in the tech industry, inspired by the "LaraGigs" project from Brad Traversy's "Laravel From Scratch 2022" course. While the original project was built using Laravel, NodeJobs has been adapted to Node.js and rebranded to match our vision. It's now powered by MongoDB Atlas as the database solution.

Credits

This project is based on the concept and design of the "LaraGigs" app by Brad Traversy. We are grateful for his invaluable teachings and inspiration in building this platform. If you're interested in the original Laravel version, be sure to check out his course.

Usage

Database Setup

NodeJobs uses MongoDB Atlas as its database. If you prefer a different database system, you can make the change by modifying the database configuration in your project.

To set up MongoDB Atlas:

    Create a MongoDB Atlas account.

    Set up a database and collection.

    Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string to the .env file.
